# Algorithms, Parts I and II (Princeton University)

This repository contains code for the exercises of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's algorithms course on Coursera. It contains the following exercises:

* Estimating the value of the percolation threshold using union-find and Monte Carlo simulation.
* Writing generic data types for deques and randomized queues.
* Recognizing collinear points in a set of points using sorting algorithms.
* Solving the 8-puzzle problem (and its generalizations) using the A\* search algorithm.
* Implementing range search and nearest-neighbour search using Kd-trees.
* Creating and interpreting a Word Net using directed graph algorithms.
* Seam carving (content-aware image resizing) using a shortest-path algorithm.
* Determining which teams in a sports division are mathematically eliminated from contention using maximum flow and minimum cut algorithms.
* Finding all valid words in a generalised n-by-n game of Boggle using ternary search tries.
* Data compression using the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
