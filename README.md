# Algorithms, Parts I and II (Princeton University)

This repository contains code for the exercises of Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's algorithms course on Coursera. It contains the following exercises:

* Estimating the value of the percolation threshold using union-find and Monte Carlo simulation.
* Writing generic data types for deques and randomized queues.
* Recognizing collinear points in a set of points using sorting algorithms.
* Solving the 8-puzzle problem (and its generalizations) using the A\* search algorithm.
* Implementing range search and nearest-neighbour search using Kd-trees.
